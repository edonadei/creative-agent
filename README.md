   GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here
   ```

4. **Run the development server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

5. **Open the application**
   Navigate to `http://localhost:3000` in your browser

### Getting a Gemini API Key
1. Visit [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey)
2. Create a new API key
3. Copy the key to your `.env.local` file

## üìñ How to Use

### Basic Chat
1. Type your message in the input field
2. The AI will classify your intent and respond appropriately
3. Watch the Action Log viewer (bottom right) for transparency into AI reasoning

### Image Prompt Generation
1. Ask for an image: "Create an image of a sunset over mountains"
2. The AI generates a detailed prompt for image generation tools
3. Hover over the prompt card and click "Add to Gallery" to save it
4. Use the prompt with DALL-E, Midjourney, or other AI image generators

### Gallery Management
1. Click the gallery icon (top right) to open the Creative Gallery
2. View your saved images and prompts
3. Delete items by hovering and clicking the delete button
4. Gallery items persist across sessions

### Session Management
1. Click the sidebar toggle (top left) to access conversations
2. Create new sessions with the "New" button
3. Switch between sessions to organize different topics
4. Rename or delete sessions as needed

### AI Reasoning Transparency
1. After each AI response, the Action Log viewer appears (bottom right)
2. Explore 4 tabs:
   - **Reasoning**: Step-by-step decision process
   - **Patterns**: Detected conversation patterns
   - **Optimization**: Token usage and cost optimization
   - **Workflow**: Suggested next steps and actions

## üéØ Advanced Features

### Communication Style Adaptation
The AI automatically detects and adapts to your communication style:
- **Direct**: Brief, concise responses
- **Casual**: Friendly, conversational tone
- **Detailed**: Comprehensive explanations with examples
- **Creative**: Engaging, imaginative responses
- **Technical**: Precise, implementation-focused
- **Formal**: Professional, structured responses

### Workflow Intelligence
- **Conversation State Tracking**: Beginning ‚Üí Developing ‚Üí Deep Dive ‚Üí Conclusion
- **Pattern-Based Suggestions**: Next steps based on your interaction history
- **Contextual Follow-ups**: AI-generated suggestions for continuing conversations
- **Incomplete Workflow Detection**: Identifies and suggests completing partial workflows

### Token Optimization
- **Smart Model Selection**: Automatically chooses Flash vs Flash Lite based on complexity
- **Conversation History Optimization**: Keeps relevant context while reducing token usage
- **Cost Estimation**: Real-time cost tracking and optimization savings
- **Performance Metrics**: Token usage, processing time, and efficiency metrics

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Current Limitations

### Technical Limitations
- **Local Storage Only**: All data is stored in browser localStorage (no cloud sync)
- **Single User**: No multi-user support or authentication
- **Browser Dependent**: Clearing browser data will reset all conversations and preferences
- **No Real Image Generation**: Generates prompts only, requires external tools for actual images

### AI Model Limitations
- **Gemini API Required**: Requires valid Google Gemini API key and quota
- **English Focused**: Optimized for English conversations
- **Context Window**: Limited by Gemini's context window (conversation history truncation)
- **Rate Limits**: Subject to Google's API rate limiting

### Feature Limitations
- **No File Uploads**: Cannot process uploaded images or documents
- **No Voice Input**: Text-based interactions only
- **No Real-time Collaboration**: Single-user experience
- **No Export Options**: No built-in export for conversations or gallery items

### Privacy & Data
- **Local Storage**: All data remains in your browser (privacy-focused but not backed up)
- **API Calls**: Conversations are sent to Google's Gemini API for processing
- **No Analytics**: No usage tracking or analytics collection
